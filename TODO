CNAME handling
--------------
The CNAME handling is terribly inefficient. A recursive nameserver is required
to deliver all intermediate results in the response to the original query. The
code however still splits up the query into each part and performs a query for
each CNAME till the end of the chain is reached.
This should be changed to follow the chain in the response of the original
query, but is not so easy because the validation only has the keys for each
original query.
A possible workaround would be to synthesize the intermediate responses from
the original query. Easy for positive responses, but for NXDOMAIN - which
NSEC(3)s are to be included...?
