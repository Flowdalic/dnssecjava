failed.authority.nodata=NODATA response has failed AUTHORITY rrset: {0}
failed.answer.cname_nodata=CNAME_NODATA response has failed ANSWER rrset: {0}
failed.nodata=NODATA response failed to prove NODATA status with NSEC/NSEC3
failed.synthesize.multiple=Synthesized CNAME RRset has multiple records - that doesn't make sense.
failed.synthesize.nomatch=Synthesized CNAME target ({0}) included in answer doesn't match DNAME synthesis rules (expected {1}).
failed.synthesize.toolong=Synthesized name would be too long, thus bogus.
failed.answer.positive=Positive response has failed ANSWER rrset: {0}
failed.authority.positive=Positive response has failed AUTHORITY rrset: {0}
failed.positive.wildcard=Positive wildcard response wasn't generated by the correct wildcard.
failed.positive.wildcardgeneration=Could not generate NSEC wildcard, resulting name would be too long.
failed.positive.wildcard_too_broad=Positive response was wildcard expansion and did not prove original data did not exist.
failed.nxdomain.cname_nxdomain=CNAME_NAMEERROR response has failed ANSWER rrset: {0}
failed.nxdomain.authority=NameError response has failed AUTHORITY rrset: {0}
failed.nxdomain.nsec3=All NSEC3s were validated but ignored due to unknown algorithms or invalid iteration counts.
failed.nxdomain.exists=NameError response has failed to prove that {0} does not exist.
failed.nxdomain.haswildcard=NameError response has failed to prove that the covering wildcard does not exist.
dnskey.no_rrset=Missing DNSKEY RRset in response to DNSKEY query for {0}.
dnskey.no_ds_match=Did not match a DS to a DNSKEY.
failed.ds=DS rrset in DS response did not verify.
failed.ds.cname=CNAME rrset in DS response did not verify.
failed.ds.nsec=NSEC RRset for the referral did not verify.
failed.ds.nsec.hasdata=NSEC RRset for the referral did not prove no DS.
insecure.ds.nsec=NSEC RRset for the referral proved no DS.
failed.ds.nsec.ent=NSEC for empty non-terminal did not verify.
insecure.ds.nsec.ent=NSEC for empty non-terminal proved no DS.
failed.ds.nsec3=NSEC3s proved bogus.
insecure.ds.nsec3=NSEC3s proved no DS.
failed.ds.unknown=Ran out of validation options, thus bogus.
failed.ds.nxdomain=DS response was NAMEERROR, thus bogus.
failed.ds.notype=Encountered an unhandled type ({0}) of DS response, thus bogus.
validate.insecure_unsigned=Unsigned response was proved to be validly INSECURE
validate.bogus=Could not establish validation of INSECURE status of unsigned response. Reason: {0}
validate.bogus.badkey=Could not establish a chain of trust to keys for {0}. Reason: {1}
validate.bogus.missingsig=Could not validate RRset due to missing signature.
validate.insecure=Verified that response is INSECURE
validate.response.unknown=Response subtype is {0} and thus cannot be validated.
insecure.ds.noalgorithms=No supported algorithms in DS RRset for {0}, treating as insecure.
